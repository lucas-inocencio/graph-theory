# Graph-Theory

A library that provides efficient implementation of graph theory algorithms and representations.

It is built with C++20, hpp modules, GCC 12.2 as the compiler and Google Test.

The library is based on the three renowned books, 'Teoria Computacional de Grafos' by Jayme Szwarcfiter, 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Thomas Cormen and 'Algorithm Design' by Jon Kleinberg.

Note: This library is currently under construction and is not yet ready for production use.

# How to run
